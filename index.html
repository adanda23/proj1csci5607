    <p>My main difficulties with this project were applying the transformations to the pictures. Applying a transformation depending on where I clicked on the object was straightforward, but figuring out how to scale the transformations with the mouse movement had stumped me for a while. Depending on how I moved the mouse, the image would scale the wrong direction or would scale by too large of a factor. Eventually I found a solution using two vectors formed with the mouse position and the rectangles position. I also had brief issues with reading in the PPM data, as my image was vertically flipped. I fixed this by calculating a flipped index and putting that instead of the regular index. Also figuring out how much leeway to give the user when dragging on a edge or corner was an extra consideration, as clicking on the exact point was difficult.</p>
